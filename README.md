# Data Structures and Algorithms in C#
This repo is to implement data structures and common useful algorithms in C#.
It started out as my journey to learn C# as a Java dev and I thought it might help someone in a similar position as me.

All the code written is tested with xUnit and .NET 7. I have tried to follow a TDD design. Generics have been used to provide support for most types.

# Data Structures
The following have been implemented.

- Linked List
  - Add element to head.
  - Add element to tail.
  - Remove element from head.
  - Remove element from tail.
- Trees
  - Traversals - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order
- Graphs
  - Graph creation.
  - Traversals - Depth-first search (DFS). Breadth-First search (BFS).
- Set
  - HashSet with collision handling using chaining technique.
- Map
  - HashMap with collision handling using chaining technique.

# Algorithms

The following have been implemented.

- Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
